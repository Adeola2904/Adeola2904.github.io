**Title: [Retail_Sales Interactive Dashboard](https://github.com/Adeola2904/Adeola2904.github.io/blob/main/Oluwafemi%20Retail%20Sales%20Dashboard.xlsx)
 
**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel (Pivot Chart, Pivot tables, Conditional formating, filters, slicers)
 
**Project Description:** This project involves analyzing retail sales revenue data to identify key trends and provide actionable recommendations. The analysis covers sales by category, quarter, year, weekday, and location. Based on these insights, strategies were developed to enhance sales performance, including focusing on high-revenue categories, boosting midweek sales, capitalizing on seasonal peaks, and optimizing top-performing store locations
 
**Key findings:** 

1. Category Breakdown by Revenue: Electronics and furniture are the primary revenue drivers, signaling high demand for these products. The smaller contribution from groceries could indicate that this category serves a niche or supplementary role.Groceries are often purchased frequently but at lower price points compared to electronics and furniture, which are typically higher items bought less frequently. This makes groceries a lower-revenue category even if the volume of transactions is higher.
2. Revenue by Quarter: The company experiences a natural spike sales in the latter half of the year, likely due to seasonal factors such as back-to-school, holiday shopping, and year-end sales events.
3. Revenue by Year: The stability between 2022 and 2023 indicates consistent performance, while the early 2024 figure is not yet a significant indicator of yearly trends due to limited data.
4. Revenue by Weekday: Weekend shopping dominates, reflecting consumer habits of shopping during leisure time. Midweek dips could suggest fewer promotional activities or less available customer time during these days,However revenue for Midweek were almost at Par which indicate customer shopping frequency.
5. Top 10 Locations by Units Sold: Congo and Korea lead in unit sales, while other locations like Anguilla and Kenya also perform well. Notably, Guinea-Bissau and Western Sahara show strong revenue despite fewer units sold. With 963 units sold, Guam is among the higher-performing locations in terms of sales volume. Its revenue of 431,198 also positions it as a strong contributor.

**Recommendations:**
1. Focus on High-Performing Categories: Electronics and furniture should be prioritized for growth strategies, such as expanding the product range, offering bundles or promotions, and improving marketing efforts.Clothing also contributes significantly and can be further leveraged with seasonal fashion promotions or cross-selling with other categories.
2. Enhance Mid-Week Sales: Since Tuesday and Wednesday are slower sales days, consider offering midweek promotions by offering exclusive rewards or discounts to drive more traffic on those days.
3. Invest more in seasonal promotions
4. To boost the sales for slower Q1 and Q2, we should consider Post-holiday sales with a sustainance marketing for the period.
5. The highest selling stores, such as in Congo, Korea, and Anguilla, should be monitored and supported with localized marketing campaigns to cater to their customer demands.
6. For the emerging markets like Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, and Kenya who are already showing potential, we should consider investing in market research for these regions to identify consumer preferences and trends to expand further.

**Title:** [HR Employee Dashboard](https://github.com/Adeola2904/Adeola2904.github.io/blob/main/HR%20Employee%20Dashboard.xlsx)
 
**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel (Pivot Chart, Pivot tables, Conditional formating, filters, slicers, Power Query Editor, Data Modelling)
 
**Project Description:** In my analysis of the HR data, I aimed to understand the composition and needs of the company's workforce to inform strategic decisions, particularly regarding promotions. My focus was identifying staff eligible for promotion based on tenure, analyzing salary distributions, understanding demographic trends, and recognizing regional representation. This comprehensive overview provides valuable insights and actionable recommendations to support the company's goal of fostering a motivated, well-compensated, and loyal workforce. 

**Key findings:** 
Long-term Employees: Nearly a quarter of the staff (19 out of 80) have been with the company for 7 years or more. This shows that many employees are committed and have stuck with the company for a long time, highlighting stability and loyalty.

Eastern Majority: Over half of the employees (51%) are from the East. This could mean that the company has strong roots in that region, which is something to keep in mind for future hiring and regional engagement.

Low Salaries for Most: A large majority (68%) of the employees are earning low salaries, while only 33 out of 80 are earning high salaries. This might suggest a need to revisit the pay structure to ensure fairness and motivate employees.

Young Workforce: The largest group of employees is aged between 29 and 34 years. This young and dynamic group is likely ambitious and energetic, ready to take on new challenges.

Family Responsibilities: With 58% of employees being married, many have family responsibilities, which could mean that financial security is a significant concern for them.

**Recommendations:**

1. Promotion and Career Development: Since many employees have been with the company for over 7 years, it's important to recognize their loyalty. While promoting based on tenure is a good start, adding performance and skill development into the criteria can motivate everyone to continually improve.

2. Review Salary Structure: With most employees earning low salaries, conducting a salary review is crucial. Aligning pay with industry standards and ensuring competitive compensation can help in retaining talented staff and keeping them motivated.

3. Support for Family-Oriented Employees: Considering that many employees have families, introducing financial wellness programs, childcare support, or flexible working hours can make a big difference. These initiatives can help employees manage their work-life balance better, leading to increased job satisfaction and productivity.

4. Develop Young Leaders: Given the youthful nature of the workforce, offering leadership development programs can harness their potential and prepare them for future roles. Additionally, recognizing the strong presence from the East, regional engagement initiatives can foster a deeper connection with the community and enhance company loyalty

**Title:** [HR Attrition Dashboard](https://github.com/Adeola2904/Adeola2904.github.io/blob/main/HR%20Attrition%20Dashboard.xlsx)
 
**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel (Pivot Chart, Pivot tables, Power Query, Conditional formating, filters, slicers, Data cleansing and Transformation, Descriptive modelling, Analysis and visual, interactive Dashboard design)
 
**Project Description:** The primary objective of this project is to investigate the factors contributing to employee attrition within the company. With a workforce of 780 employees and an overall attrition rate of 30% (234 employees having left the company), It is crucial for me to understand the demographic, performance, and job role trends that may explain why employees are departing. By examining attrition across different dimensions such as age, gender, job role, salary, and performance ratings, the goal is to derive actionable insights that can help the company develop targeted retention strategies and improve employee satisfaction, leading to reduced turnover.
 
**Key findings:** 

In reviewing the data, some clear patterns have emerged regarding employee attrition. By looking at different factors such as age, gender, performance, and job roles,  below are the key findings that shed light on why people are leaving and where we may need to focus our efforts.

**Attrition by Age Group** The mid-career employees (31-40 years) are experiencing higher attrition. This could be a result of several factors such as career dissatisfaction, lack of growth opportunities, or competing offers from other companies at this stage of their careers

**Attrition by Gender** Female employees are leaving at a higher rate compared to their male counterparts. This may point to gender-specific challenges such as work-life balance, opportunities for advancement, or possibly issues related to workplace inclusivity and equality.

**Attrition by Performance Rating** It is clear that the majority of employees leaving fall under the Poor and Average performance categories. This may indicate that these employees are either being managed out of the company or are leaving due to disengagement or dissatisfaction with their roles.

**Attrition by Salary Range** Surprisingly, both Low and High salary brackets are experiencing high attrition. This suggests that factors beyond compensation, such as job satisfaction, growth potential, and work environment, may be influencing turnover.

**Attrition by Job Role** Roles that are more technical and specialized (e.g., Specialist, Engineer) have higher turnover rates, which may indicate a competitive job market for these skills. Managers and Accountants, who may have more stability or different job satisfaction factors, had lower turnover

**Recommendations**

1. With employees in the 31-40 age group showing the highest attrition, it is important to provide clear career development paths, mentorship opportunities, and avenues for internal mobility to keep this cohort engaged.
2. Consider conducting stay interviews to better understand what is driving this group to leave and address any underlying issues.
3. Since 34% of the female workforce has left, higher than the male attrition rate, it may be beneficial to review policies around flexibility, work-life balance, and opportunities for advancement, particularly for women.
4. Implement initiatives to promote gender diversity in leadership roles and ensure an inclusive work environment.
5. A large number of Poor and Average performers are leaving, which may indicate a lack of support or development opportunities for these employees. Implementing performance improvement plans, providing targeted training, and creating a culture of continuous feedback could help reduce turnover in this segment.
6. Focus on understanding the root causes of disengagement among these employees and addressing gaps in role alignment or job satisfaction.
7. Although salary is not the only factor driving attrition, the company should ensure that its compensation structure is competitive within the industry. Conducting a salary benchmarking exercise could reveal whether certain salary brackets are contributing to dissatisfaction.
8. Alongside compensation, highlight non-monetary benefits, such as professional development, flexible working conditions, and employee recognition programs.
9. Establish a real-time dashboard to track attrition across various demographics and roles on an ongoing basis. This will allow HR to intervene more quickly if concerning trends emerge.
10. Conduct exit interviews with departing employees to gain further insights into the specific reasons behind their decisions to leave and use these insights to adjust retention strategies.
